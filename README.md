# Time Series Analysis for Gasoline Demand Forecasting
## Executive Summary
This project revolves around time series analysis aimed at forecasting gasoline demand. Through meticulous exploration and modeling, we achieved successful predictions. Our journey encompassed the thorough analysis of time series plots, trend and seasonality identification, data transformation for stationarity, and model estimation. Leveraging techniques like Box Cox transformation and SARIMA models, we arrived at a satisfactory model for predicting gasoline demand.

## Introduction
This project focuses on Monthly gasoline demand in millions of gallons, spanning from January 1960 to December 1975, originating in Ontario. Our objective is to forecast gasoline demand for the subsequent year. Employing various techniques including Box Cox transformations and SARIMA models, we endeavor to craft a robust predictive model for the gasoline demand in millions of gallons for the year 1976.

## Conclusion
The conducted testing and forecasting produced compelling results. Our predictions generally align well with the expected intervals. Occasional deviations, such as at time 177 due to a sharp decline in demand, offer valuable insights for refining our model. By employing a mixed model and various time series analysis techniques, we achieved a predictive equation that serves as a strong foundation for forecasting future gasoline demand, facilitating applications to subsequent years such as 1980 and beyond.
